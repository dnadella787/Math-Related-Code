This repo is all the code that I have written related to math topics I have learned in my classes. It is mostly code for numerical methods or methods of optimization. 

LineSearch1d --> 1D minimization methods, more info in the README in the directory. Currently have bisection method, fibonacci method, golden section method, and newtons method.

GradientDescMethods --> R^n gradient descent methods. Currently have gradient descent and Nesterov's acceleration. More info in README in directory.

ConjugateGradientDescent --> working on adding other non quadratic methods and basic conjugate gradient descent. Also considering adding conjugate direction method as well. The ones that are there already work in R^n. More info in README in directory.
