This repo is all the code that I have written related to math topics I have learned in my classes. It is mostly code for numerical methods or methods of optimization. 

LineSearch1d --> 1D minimization methods, more info in the README in the directory

GradientDescMethods --> currently only includes 1D implementation of gradient descent and nesterov's acceleration but I am currently working on gradient descent and nesterov's acceleration in R^n

ConjugateGradientDescent --> working on adding other non quadratic methods and basic conjugate gradient descent. Also considering adding conjugate direction method as well. The ones that are there already work in R^n.
